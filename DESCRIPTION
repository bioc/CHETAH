Description: CHETAH (CHaracterization of cEll Types Aided by Hierarchical classification) is an accurate, selective and fast scRNA-seq classifier. 
	  Classification is guided by a reference dataset,
    preferentially also a scRNA-seq dataset. By hierarchical clustering of the reference data, CHETAH creates
	  a classification tree that enables a step-wise, top-to-bottom classification. Using a novel stopping rule,
	  CHETAH classifies the input cells to the cell types of the references and to "intermediate types": more general
	  classifications that ended in an intermediate node of the tree.
